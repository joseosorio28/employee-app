# Employee Application

This README file provides information and instructions for setting up and running a SpringBoot application with a `.war` executable file.

## Application Overview

The application is designed to run as a standalone web application using the Spring Framework. It is packaged as a `.war` file, which can be deployed on a compatible Java web server.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher
- Gradle

## Getting Started

To set up and run the SpringBoot application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code of the application.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.

## Building the Application

To build the application, use the following command:

```bash
gradle clean build
```
This command will compile the source code, run tests, and package the application into a .war file located in the build/libs/ directory.

## Deploying the Application
To deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. Copy the generated .war file from the build/libs/ directory to the deployment directory of your Java web server.
2. Start the Java web server.
3. Access the application using the server's URL and the context path specified in the deployment.

## Configuration
The SpringBoot application can be configured through the application.yml file, which is located in the src/main/resources/ directory. Modify this file to change the application's settings, such as database connections, server ports, or other properties specific to your environment.

## Running the Application Locally
To run the application locally for development or testing purposes, you can use the following Maven command:

```bash
gradle bootRun
```

This command will start an embedded Tomcat server and deploy the application on it. You can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080 (or the port specified in the configuration).

## Additional Resources
For more information on configuring and deploying SpringBoot applications, refer to the official SpringBoot documentation:

- [SpringBoot Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/)

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the application, here are a few common troubleshooting steps:

- Make sure you have the correct Java Development Kit (JDK) installed and configured in your system's PATH.
- Double-check the application's configuration file (application.yml) for any errors or misconfigurations.
- Review the logs generated by the Java web server for any error messages or stack traces that might help diagnose the issue.

If you are unable to resolve the problem, feel free to seek help from the SpringBoot community or consult the official documentation.
